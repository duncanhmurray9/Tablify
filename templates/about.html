        <p>Tablify was made out of necessity (and laziness) due to the fact that I cannot decide what songs to learn on guitar.</p>
        <p>I thought that displaying the guitar tab links from my own playists and from my top songs would help me decide a little bit better. Now I have too many choices!</p>
